# HorseRacing GUI (RacePad)


A project to create a GUI for the Raspberry PI that makes computing and the internet 
available to my Grandad, who loves horse racing but cannot interact with technology.

Scrapes data relating to horse prices, race cards and creates easily clickable links.

Designed and incorporated into a portable touch screen with custom squid buttons
